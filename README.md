## Introduction

The following tool allows to make an automated analysis of Fireup keypoints, based on Architecture Best Practice Framework Documented under the [following link](https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/oci-best-practices/)

The check is currently spread in 4 major areas

- Security and Compliance
- Reliability and Resilience
- Performance and Cost Optimization
- Operational Efficiency

The following is the detail of areas of interest
